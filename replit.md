# VitalTones™ - Binaural Beat Generator

## Overview

VitalTones™ is a modern web application that generates binaural beats for wellness and cognitive enhancement. The application features a React-based frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database operations. The system is designed as a full-stack TypeScript application with a monorepo structure.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API for binaural beat generation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API with `/api` prefix
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for development server

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe schema definitions
- **Schema Location**: Shared schema in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Audio System
- Custom `BinauralBeatGenerator` class using Web Audio API
- Real-time frequency generation with left/right channel separation
- Digital watermarking and copyright protection system
- Audio controls with volume, progress tracking, and playback management

### UI Components
- Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library integration
- Custom audio player components (`AudioPlayer`, `FloatingPlayer`)
- Category-based tone organization (`CategoryCard`, `ToneCard`)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Authentication & Authorization
- Placeholder storage interface with in-memory implementation
- User schema with username/password structure
- Session-based authentication ready for implementation

### Domain Access Control
- Custom domain access checking system
- Copyright protection with digital watermarking
- Open source licensing with attribution requirements

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: React frontend makes API calls to Express backend
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle business logic and data operations
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to React frontend
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages client-side caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API (browser native)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Development Dependencies
- **Build**: Vite with React plugin
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Linting**: TypeScript compiler for type checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to `/dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `/dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` script

### Production Configuration
- **Server**: Node.js production server serving static files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Static Assets**: Express serves built React app from `/dist/public`

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)

### Scripts
- `dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `start`: Production server execution
- `db:push`: Database schema deployment
